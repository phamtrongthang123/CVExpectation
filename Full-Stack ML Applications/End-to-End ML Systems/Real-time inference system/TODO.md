# Real-time Inference System - TODO

## Project Overview
Build a system for real-time model inference with low latency requirements.

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Choose inference framework (TensorRT, ONNX, etc.)
- [ ] Implement model optimization techniques
- [ ] Design streaming data pipeline
- [ ] Add model caching and warming
- [ ] Implement load balancing
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Create performance benchmarking
- [ ] Implement fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Add A/B testing capabilities

## Notes
- Focus on latency optimization and throughput
- Consider edge deployment scenarios
- Implement proper resource management
