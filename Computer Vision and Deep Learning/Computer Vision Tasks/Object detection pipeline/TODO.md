# Object Detection Pipeline - TODO

## Project Overview
Build an end-to-end object detection system.

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Choose detection framework (YOLO, R-CNN, etc.)
- [ ] Prepare annotated dataset
- [ ] Implement data preprocessing
- [ ] Train object detection model
- [ ] Add non-maximum suppression
- [ ] Create inference pipeline
- [ ] Evaluate performance (mAP, precision, recall)
- [ ] Document results

## Notes
- Consider real-time vs accuracy trade-offs
- Use libraries like ultralytics (YOLOv8), detectron2, or torchvision for detection
- Implement bounding box visualization with OpenCV or matplotlib
- PyTorch Lightning for training structure and TorchMetrics for detection metrics (mAP)
- Hugging Face transformers for DETR and modern transformer-based detection models
