# Image Segmentation System - TODO

## Project Overview
Build semantic or instance segmentation models for pixel-level classification.

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Choose segmentation approach (U-Net, Mask R-CNN, etc.)
- [ ] Prepare pixel-level annotated dataset
- [ ] Implement data augmentation
- [ ] Design segmentation architecture
- [ ] Implement training with proper loss functions
- [ ] Add IoU and Dice coefficient metrics
- [ ] Create mask visualization tools
- [ ] Test on different image types

## Notes
- Consider semantic vs instance segmentation
- Implement proper handling of class boundaries
- Use appropriate loss functions (Dice, Focal loss)
