# Image Classification System - TODO

## Project Overview
Build a CNN from scratch or fine-tune existing models for image classification.

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Collect/prepare dataset
- [ ] Implement data preprocessing
- [ ] Design CNN architecture
- [ ] Implement training loop
- [ ] Add evaluation metrics
- [ ] Create visualization tools
- [ ] Document results

## Notes
- Consider using transfer learning with pre-trained models
- Experiment with different architectures (ResNet, VGG, etc.)
- Track model performance and hyperparameters
