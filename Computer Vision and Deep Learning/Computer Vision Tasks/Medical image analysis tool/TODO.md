# Medical Image Analysis Tool - TODO

## Project Overview
Develop tools for analyzing medical images (X-rays, MRI, CT scans, etc.).

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Research medical imaging datasets
- [ ] Implement DICOM file handling
- [ ] Design preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Implement segmentation/classification models
- [ ] Add medical-specific evaluation metrics
- [ ] Create visualization tools
- [ ] Ensure HIPAA compliance considerations
- [ ] Document medical use cases

## Notes
- Focus on specific medical condition (pneumonia, tumors, etc.)
- Use pydicom for DICOM file handling and SimpleITK for medical image processing
- Consider class imbalance with scikit-learn's imbalanced-learn library
- PyTorch Lightning for medical model training and TorchMetrics for medical-specific metrics
