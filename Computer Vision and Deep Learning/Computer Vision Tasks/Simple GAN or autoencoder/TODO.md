# Simple GAN or Autoencoder - TODO

## Project Overview
Implement generative models for image synthesis or reconstruction.

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Choose between GAN or Autoencoder
- [ ] Implement generator/encoder architecture
- [ ] Implement discriminator/decoder (for GAN/AE)
- [ ] Design training loop with proper loss functions
- [ ] Add training stability techniques
- [ ] Implement image generation/reconstruction
- [ ] Create quality evaluation metrics
- [ ] Visualize generated samples

## Notes
- For GAN: Use PyTorch or TensorFlow implementations with proper loss functions
- For Autoencoder: Consider using PyTorch Lightning for easier training loops
- Use torchvision or PIL for image processing and matplotlib for visualization
- TorchMetrics can help with tracking training metrics consistently
- Hugging Face diffusers for modern diffusion models and image generation
