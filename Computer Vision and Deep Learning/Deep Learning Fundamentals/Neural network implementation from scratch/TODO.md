# Neural Network Implementation from Scratch - TODO

## Project Overview
Build neural networks using only NumPy or basic PyTorch operations.

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Implement basic matrix operations
- [ ] Create activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)
- [ ] Implement forward propagation
- [ ] Implement backpropagation algorithm
- [ ] Add gradient descent optimization
- [ ] Create different layer types (Dense, Conv2D)
- [ ] Implement loss functions
- [ ] Test on simple datasets (XOR, MNIST)
- [ ] Compare with framework implementations

## Notes
- Focus on understanding the mathematical foundations
- Implement gradient checking for verification
- Document the mathematical derivations
