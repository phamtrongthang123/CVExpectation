# Custom Loss Functions and Training Loops - TODO

## Project Overview
Implement specialized loss functions and flexible training procedures.

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Implement common loss functions from scratch
- [ ] Create domain-specific loss functions
- [ ] Design flexible training loop architecture
- [ ] Add learning rate scheduling
- [ ] Implement different optimizers (SGD, Adam, etc.)
- [ ] Add regularization techniques
- [ ] Create training monitoring and logging
- [ ] Implement early stopping and checkpointing
- [ ] Test on various tasks

## Notes
- Implement losses like Focal, Dice, Triplet using PyTorch or TensorFlow
- Use libraries like torch.optim for optimizers and torch.amp for mixed precision
- Implement gradient clipping with torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_
- Consider PyTorch Lightning for structured training loops and TorchMetrics for evaluation
