# Time Series Analysis Tool - TODO

## Project Overview
Build comprehensive tools for time series data analysis and forecasting.

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Implement data preprocessing for time series
- [ ] Add trend and seasonality analysis
- [ ] Create forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM)
- [ ] Implement anomaly detection
- [ ] Add statistical tests and validation
- [ ] Create visualization tools
- [ ] Implement backtesting framework
- [ ] Add confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification
- [ ] Create automated reporting

## Notes
- Use pandas for data manipulation and statsmodels for ARIMA
- Implement Prophet (fbprophet) and LSTM with PyTorch/TensorFlow
- Use scikit-learn for preprocessing and cross-validation
