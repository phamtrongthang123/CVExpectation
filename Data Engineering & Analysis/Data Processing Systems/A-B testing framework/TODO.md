- [ ] Create data collection pipeline
- [ ] Implement statistical analysis tools
- [ ] Add experiment monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Create automated reporting
- [ ] Implement sequential testing capabilities
- [ ] Add multi-armed bandit algorithms

## Notes
- Use scipy.stats for statistical testing and numpy for randomization
- Implement power calculations with statsmodels.stats.power
- Use pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualization
