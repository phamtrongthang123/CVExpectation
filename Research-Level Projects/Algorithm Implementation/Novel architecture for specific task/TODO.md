# Novel Architecture for Specific Task - TODO

## Project Overview
Design and implement a novel neural network architecture for a specific task.

## Tasks
- [ ] Choose specific problem domain
- [ ] Research existing approaches and limitations
- [ ] Design novel architecture components
- [ ] Implement the new architecture
- [ ] Create comprehensive evaluation framework
- [ ] Compare against baseline methods
- [ ] Conduct ablation studies
- [ ] Analyze computational complexity
- [ ] Document design decisions and insights
- [ ] Prepare research paper draft

## Notes
- Focus on clear motivation for design choices
- Ensure fair comparison with existing methods
- Consider both performance and efficiency
- Use Hugging Face transformers as baseline for comparison with modern architectures
