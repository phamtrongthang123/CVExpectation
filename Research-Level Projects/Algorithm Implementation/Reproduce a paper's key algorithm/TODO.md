# Reproduce a Paper's Key Algorithm - TODO

## Project Overview
Select and reproduce the key algorithm from a recent research paper.

## Tasks
- [ ] Choose target paper and algorithm
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Study and understand the algorithm thoroughly
- [ ] Implement the core algorithm
- [ ] Reproduce experimental setup
- [ ] Create or obtain datasets used in paper
- [ ] Run experiments and compare results
- [ ] Document implementation details
- [ ] Identify and analyze discrepancies
- [ ] Create reproducibility report

## Notes
- Choose papers with available code or clear descriptions
- Focus on understanding rather than perfect reproduction
- Document all assumptions and modifications made
